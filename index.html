	      <h2>What is Ionic?</h2>
	      <p>
		Ionic is a front-end SDK for building cross-platform mobile apps built on AngularJS & Apache Cordova. What does this mean? Simply put, Ionic serves to help make the process of creating applications easier.

	      <h2>History of Ionic</h2>
	      <p>
		Ionic was created by Drifty Co., a team consisting of Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley, in 2013. Originally, they set out to make tools that simplified the process through drag and drop tools using jQuery Mobile and Bootstrap. However, after hearing from customers, they set forth to create their own framework focused on performance and modern standards.

	      <h2>Ionic versus Cordova (Phone Gap)</h2>
	      <p>
		Does Ionic replace Cordova? No, Ionic is simply a UI library, an add-on, to Cordova. It can be compared to Bootstrap for desktop sites, but used for mobile applications.

	  <h2>How do you use Ionic?</h2>

	  <p>
	    In order to use Ionic, you must first make sure you have AngularJS downloaded. The command to install this is in one of the sources below. You may also need to download load Cordova. Once you have these downloaded, you can start developing your mobile application.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    You can start a new project by using the command line interface. Enter "ionic start [APP_NAME] [TEMPLATE]". Replace APP_NAME with the name of your new application and TEMPLATE with the template you wish to use. You may choose from a variety of starting templates, including a blank one. The default starting template showcases the use of tabs (i.e. chat tabs or a settings tab). Each template comes with its own html, css, and Javascript file if needed. The user is free to choose the template that best fits their needs.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Once you have enough progress on your application, you can use Ionic to run and test it. This will simulate a mobile operating system and show you what it would look like on a phone. You can do this by typing in "ionic serve." This will run your application on localhost:8000. You can then go there on your computer. You can also run a different command, also in another source below, to instead have your application run on your IP address. Yu can then type in your IP address into your phone's browser and view it from there. Lastly, if you have an android device, you can plug it into your computer and type in "ionic run android" to run it on your device.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Once you're happy with your application, you can start taking steps to publish your application. Firstly, you must uninstall any debug features that came with ionic. To do this, type in "cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-console" into the command line. Then, type in "cordova build -release android" to package your application into a form that is usable by android.
